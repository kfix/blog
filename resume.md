**Roles I've performed**
====

-   System Adminstrator/Engineer
-   Office Support
-   Field Support Consultant
-   Small Site Support Consultant

**My objectives**
====

*Automate tedious and simple procedures.*

-   Make computers work for us, not the other way around.
-   Reclaim time for constructive work.
-   Prevent making procedural mistakes.
-   Document critical processes that otherwise stay in (volatile)
    institutional memory.

*Work with others.*

-   Communicate before, during, and after changes to systems are
    made.
-   Solicit advice and review all upcoming plans or current issues.
-   Help others to find solutions to their problems. It makes them
    happy. They will then do the same for me.
-   Learn everyone's specialties before a crisis emerge. Calling on
    them when a crisis happens will then be automatic.
-   Make information that is always in demand self-publishing.
    Others can use that information to improve the organization in ways
    I might not predict.

*Look for enhancements.*

-   Research and document all of an organization's systems. I can't
    improve what I don't know.
-   Build and use pervasive monitoring infrastructure to find
    patterns and bottlenecks.
-   Stay up-to-date on best practices by reading from and talking
    to the wider sysadmin community,

*Build for the future.*

-   Determine and implement the scope of recoverability and
    redundancy desired for a system before the system is deployed.
-   Create modular, customizable, and documented systems that can
    be duplicated and customized

*Prioritize time and effort to fit the organization's goals.*

-   Start in small, concrete and immediate steps every work day to
    improve systems. Other ways can be unsustainable, ineffecient, or
    too narrowly focused.
-   Work only on the problems that pertain to a goal or function of
    the organization's business. Anything else is worthy of note but
    not time.
